# Unveiling New York City Parking Violation Data Analysis (Big_Data_Project)
# Project Overview:
Welcome to the Unveiling New York City Parking Violation project! In this project, we aim to uncover valuable 
insights from the extensive dataset of parking violations in New York City. By leveraging big data technologies 
such as Pyspark, Glue, Athena, and Cloud Formation Template (CFT), we will process the raw data stored in the S3 data lake. 
Subsequently, we will utilize Tableau software for analysis and visualization.

# Project Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to extract actionable insights from the vast amount of parking violation data 
in New York City. These insights will be instrumental in enhancing traffic management strategies, facilitating city 
planning efforts, and ultimately improving the overall accessibility and efficiency of NYC.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
To achieve our project objective, we will focus on the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Areas with Higher Frequency of Violations: Identify geographical areas in NYC with a higher concentration of 
parking violations.

Temporal Analysis: Analyze patterns in violations based on time (hourly, daily), days of the week, months, and years 
to identify peak violation periods.

Most Common Violations: Determine the most frequently occurring parking violations in NYC.

Vehicle Size Analysis: Examine parking violations based on vehicle size to understand if certain vehicle types are
more prone to violations.

Revenue Generation from Fines: Analyze the revenue generated from parking fines and explore its influence on 
violation patterns.

Vehicle Types Involved: Investigate the types of vehicles involved in parking violations to identify any trends or 
preferences.

Agencies Issuing Violations: Examine the distribution of violations among different issuing agencies to understand
enforcement dynamics.

# Project Setup:
To replicate and run this project, follow these steps:

Data Collection: Obtain the raw parking violation data from the official sources and store it in the designated S3 data lake.

Data Processing: Use Pyspark, Glue, Athena for the processing of raw data and CFT (Infrastructure as Code) for automation. 
                 Ensure that the processed data is stored in a format compatible with Tableau.

Data Analysis: Utilize Athena to query the data and perform analysis. 
               Explore various dimensions of the data to uncover meaningful insights based on the above KPIs.

Visualization: Utilize Athena Driver to establish a conection to the Tableau software to import the processed data.
                Create informative visualizations in Tableau based on the analysis.
